# DataPreparation_QASS2025

Thank you for reading my book and coming to the online Appendix!

The templates folder includes all the templates I talked about in the book, including templates for:
- a detailed and simple README
- a primary script file (in Stata and R)
- a regular script file (in Stata and R)
- code review
- a data management appendix
- a sensitivity analysis appendix

I also included code to recreate examples from the book. These are in The General Social Survey (GSS) folder (work_GenSocSurvey) and (work_LitReview).
Finally, I included a folder (work_generalExamples) with some example script files with simple code that may be helpful for doing basic data preparation tasks.

The GSS and General Examples folder are both zipped completely. Just download and expand on your computer.

The Literature review folder was larger, so I had to compress folders within the larger folder. Consider downloading only the Stata or R files.

If there are any questions, errors noticed, or anything else, please do not hesitate to contact me: bianca.manago@vanderbilt.edu.
